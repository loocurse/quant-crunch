# Python Backend for Web Interface

## TODO

- [ ] Provide API for frontend
- [ ] Logging

## Setup

To setup the environment, you may want to use
[pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) as it might be easier to specify the
python version and to activate the environment:

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

Alternatively, installing through `pip` would work as well. You are strongly
recommended to use python `3.9` and above if you're installing with `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the server:

```bash
pipenv run start
```

or

```bash
python main.py
```
